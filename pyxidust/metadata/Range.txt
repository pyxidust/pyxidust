The raw .las files were loaded into a LAS dataset and used to create a LAS layer with the Make LAS Dataset Layer tool (first returns only). The layer was then used as the input to the LAS Dataset to Raster tool observing the following parameters: value field = elevation, binning cell assignment = maximum, binning void fill method = natural neighbor, output data type = float, sampling type = observations, sampling value = 50000. The DSM surface was then used as the input to the Focal Statistics tool using a 3x3 cell rectangle neighborhood and 'Range' statistics type. This operation filled-in areas of no data due to the laser return spread and also enhanced the visual hierarchy of features typically needed from a first return surface such as building edges, overhead powerlines, and tree canopies.
