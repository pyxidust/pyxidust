Vegetation density is the ratio of vegetation lidar hits to total lidar hits 
within a unit area. To create the necessary datasets to calculate vegetation 
density, two identical sets of tools were used with parameters adjusted in 
each set for ground points and aboveground points. In each set, a las layer 
was created representing ground or aboveground points using the Make LAS 
Dataset Layer tool and used as input to the LAS Point Stats As Raster tool 
with the point count method and a cell size 4 times the nominal point spacing 
of the raw lidar (5.25 feet). The stats raster was used in Null and Con 
operations via the spatial analyst IsNull and Con tools in order to assign 
values of 0/1 for areas of data/no data. The resulting Con raster from each 
set of tools was added using the Plus tool and converted to float-type pixel 
values using the Float tool in order to configure the raster to properly store 
the desired final density values of 0.00 to 1.00. In the final operation, the 
Con raster representing the aboveground points was divided by the float 
raster. The resulting vegetation density raster contains pixel values ranging 
from 0.00 to 1.00 where 0.00 is an area of low density and 1.00 is an area of 
high density. Areas of surface water contain NoData values.
