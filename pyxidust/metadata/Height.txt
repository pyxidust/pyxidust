To create the digital elevation model, raw .las files were loaded into a LAS 
dataset and used to create a LAS layer with the Make LAS Dataset Layer tool 
(class code 2 for 'Ground'). The layer was then used as the input to the LAS 
Dataset To Raster tool observing the following parameters: value field = 
elevation, triangulation interpolation using natural neighbor and a 
window-size maximum of 0, output data type = float, sampling type = 
observations, sampling value = 50,000. These operations produced a raster 
suitable for obtaining ground elevations in the minus operation below. To 
create the digital surface model, raw .las files were loaded into a LAS 
dataset and used to create a LAS layer with the Make LAS Dataset Layer tool 
(first returns only). The layer was then used as the input to the LAS Dataset 
to Raster tool observing the following parameters: value field = elevation, 
binning cell assignment = maximum, binning void fill method = natural 
neighbor, output data type = float, sampling type = observations, sampling 
value = 50,000. These operations produced a raster suitable for obtaining 
building/tree canopy elevations in the minus operation below. The minus tool 
was then used to subtract the DEM from the DSM (building/tree canopy 
elevations - ground surface elevations) to yield a raster representing the 
height for various features across the are of interest. Pixel values represent
the height of the feature captured within each cell.
