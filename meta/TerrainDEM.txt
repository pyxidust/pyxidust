The raw .las files were loaded into a multipoint feature class using the Las To Multipoint tool (average point spacing = 1.31 ft, class code 2 for ground returns). The Create Terrain tool was used to create the container dataset (maximum overview size of 100000, pyramid type = window size, window size method = z mean). Pyramids were created using the Add Terrain Pyramid level tool (window size/reference scales: 2.5 1200; 5 2500; 7 5000; 15 10000; 20 24000; 25 62500; 30 100000). The multipoint feature class was loaded into the terrain using the Add Feature Class To Terrain Tool (height field = shape, surface feature type = mass points). Finally, the terrain dataset was populated with the Build Terrain tool.
