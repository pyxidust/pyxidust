The raw .las files were loaded into a LAS dataset and used to create a LAS layer with the Make LAS Dataset Layer tool (class code 2 for 'Ground'). The layer was then used as the input to the LAS Dataset to Raster tool observing the following parameters: value field = elevation, triangulation interpolation using natural neighbor and a window-size maximum of 0, output data type = float, sampling type = observations, sampling value = 50000. The resulting DEM was used as the input to the Hillshade tool using a z-factor of 3 and multi-directional light sources.
