The raw .las files were loaded into a LAS dataset. Lidar points in the LASD were classified as building hits using the Classify Las Building tool (using 1 for height/area to allow all footprints in the next step to participate in the analysis). The newly-classified points now had a class code value of 6 representing building hits and the LASD was used as the input to the Las Building Multipatch tool (analysis masked by a polygon representing the known extent of building footprints from last year's lidar, ground elevations pulled from the digital elevation model created during this year's lidar analysis).
