The raw .las files were loaded into a LAS dataset and used to create a LAS layer with the Make LAS Dataset Layer tool (first returns only). The layer was then used as the input to the LAS Dataset to Raster tool observing the following parameters: value field = elevation, binning cell assignment = maximum, binning void fill method = natural neighbor, output data type = float, sampling type = observations, sampling value = 50000.
